    <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    <p>Preparation:<br>

Cook the jasmine rice ahead of time and let it cool. Day-old rice works best for fried rice as it's drier and less likely to clump together.<br>
Vegetable Prep:<br>

Chop the mixed vegetables into small, uniform pieces.<br>
Cooking Eggs:<br>

Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
Add the beaten eggs and scramble them until just cooked. Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.<br>
Stir-Fry Vegetables:<br>

In the same pan, add the remaining oil. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.<br>
Add the mixed vegetables and cook until they are tender yet still crisp.<br>
Adding Rice:<br>

Add the cooked and cooled rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and mix well with the vegetables.<br>
Sauce and Seasoning:<br>

Pour soy sauce and oyster sauce over the rice and mix thoroughly.<br>
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add a few drops of sesame oil for extra flavor if desired.<br>
Combining Ingredients:<br>

Add the cooked eggs back to the pan and mix them in with the rice and vegetables.<br>
Finishing Touch:<br>

Stir in sliced green onions and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until everything is well combined and heated through.<br>
Garnish and Serve:<br>

Garnish with fresh cilantro or additional chopped green onions if desired.<br>
Serve hot as a standalone dish or as a side with your favorite protein.<br>
